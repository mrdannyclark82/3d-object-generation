# 3D Object Generation Blueprint

## Description

The 3D Object Generation Blueprint is an end-to-end generative AI workflow that allows users to prototype 3D scenes quickly by simply describing the scene. The Blueprint takes a user’s 3D scene idea, generates object recommendations, associated prompts and previews using a Llama 3.1 8B LLM and NVIDIA SANA, and ready-to-use 3D objects with Microsoft TRELLIS.  

> This blueprint supports the following NVIDIA GPUs:  RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 4090, RTX 4080, RTX 6000 Ada. We're planning to add wider GPU support in the near future. We recommend at least 48 GB of system RAM. 

## Features

- Chat interface for scene planning
- AI-assisted object and prompt generation
- Automatic 3D asset generation from text prompts
- Blender import functionality for generated assets
- VRAM management with model termination

## Installation 

### Prerequisites
The NIM Prerequisite Installer requires Microsoft User Account Control (UAC) to be enabled.  UAC is enabled by default for Windows, but if it has been disabled, it must be enabled to ensure successful installation of the NIM Prerequisite Installer.  More information on Microsoft UAC can found [HERE](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/user-account-control-settings-d5b2046b-dcb8-54eb-f732-059f321afe18)

Use winget to install Miniconda:
```
winget install miniconda3
```
Download the [NIM Prerequisite Installer](https://assets.ngc.nvidia.com/products/api-catalog/rtx/NIMSetup.exe), and run the NIMSetup.exe file, and follow the instructions in the setup dialogs. This will install the necessary system components to work with NVIDIA NIMs on your system.

You will need to reboot your computer to complete the installation.

Git is required and should be installed using winget from a command prompt::
```
winget install --id Git.Git 
```
Install Git LFS (large file system) support
```
winget install --id=GitHub.GitLFS  -e
```

This blueprint requires the installation of Blender. The blueprint has been tested with the Blender 4.27 LTS (Long Term Support) build.

<details><summary><h2> Manual Installation Guide for Trellis Project</h2></summary>

This guide provides a step-by-step manual for setting up the Trellis environment on a Windows system with Conda, as a manual alternative to running the operations via the `install.bat` script. It covers checking prerequisites, creating a Conda environment, installing dependencies, setting environment variables, downloading models, installing Blender addons, and verifying services by starting, checking, and stopping them.

**Prerequisites:**
- Conda must be installed and added to your system's PATH.
- Required files in the current directory: `requirements-torch.txt`, `requirements.txt`, `set_environment_variable.py`, `download_models.py`, `check_services.py`.
- Subdirectories: `blender` (containing `NV_Trellis_Addon.py` and `asset_importer.py`), `nim_llm` (containing `run_llama.py` and `manager.py`), `nim_trellis` (containing `run_trellis.py` and `manager.py`).
- Blender installed (versions 4.2 to 5.0 supported; defaults to 4.2 if no version detected).

Run commands in a Command Prompt with administrative privileges where possible. Replace placeholders (e.g., paths) as needed for your setup.

## Step 1: Check for Conda Installation
1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Run: `where conda`.
3. If Conda is not found (errorlevel ≠ 0), install Conda from the official website (e.g., Miniconda or Anaconda) and add it to PATH. Exit if not installed.

## Step 2: Verify Requirements Files
1. Ensure `requirements-torch.txt` exists in the current directory. If not, obtain it and place it there.
2. Ensure `requirements.txt` exists in the current directory. If not, obtain it and place it there.
3. If either file is missing, stop the process and resolve the issue.

## Step 3: Locate Conda Installation Path
1. Check common Conda installation paths:
   - `%USERPROFILE%\miniconda3`
   - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\miniconda3`
   - `%USERPROFILE%\anaconda3`
2. Verify the presence of `Scripts\conda.exe` or `condabin\conda.bat` in one of these paths.
3. If not found, verify your Conda installation and adjust paths manually. Set `CONDA_PATH` to the valid location.

## Step 4: Accept Anaconda Terms of Service (If Applicable)
1. Run the following commands to accept terms for Anaconda channels (note: this may be specific to certain setups; skip if `conda tos accept` is not recognized):
   - `conda tos accept --override-channels --channel https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main`
   - `conda tos accept --override-channels --channel https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r`
   - `conda tos accept --override-channels --channel https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/msys2`
2. If the command fails, check Conda documentation for equivalent configuration steps (e.g., using `conda config`).

## Step 5: Create or Verify Conda Environment
1. List existing environments: `conda env list`.
2. If "trellis" does not exist:
   - Create it: `conda create -n trellis python=3.11.9 -y`.
3. If creation fails, troubleshoot Conda issues (e.g., network, permissions).

## Step 6: Activate Conda Environment
1. Activate: `conda activate trellis`.
2. If activation fails, ensure the environment exists and retry.

## Step 7: Update Pip and Install Build Tools
1. Upgrade pip and wheel: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel`.
2. Install setuptools: `python -m pip install setuptools==75.8.2`. (Note: Version is hardcoded; use latest if needed.)
3. If any installation fails, check pip logs or network connectivity.

## Step 8: Install Torch Requirements
1. Install packages from file: `pip install -r requirements-torch.txt`.
2. If fails, verify the file contents and resolve dependency conflicts.

## Step 9: Install Main Requirements
1. Install packages from file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. If fails, verify the file contents and resolve dependency conflicts.

## Step 10: Set Environment Variable
1. Run: `python set_environment_variable.py` (this sets `CHAT_TO_3D_PATH`).
2. Verify the variable is set: `echo %CHAT_TO_3D_PATH%`.
3. If the script fails, inspect `set_environment_variable.py` for issues.

## Step 11: Download Required Models
1. Note your current directory: `echo %cd%`.
2. Run: `python download_models.py`.
3. If fails, check the script for download URLs and ensure internet access.
4. Return to the original directory if changed.

## Step 12: Install Blender Addons
1. Verify `blender` folder exists with `NV_Trellis_Addon.py` and `asset_importer.py`.
2. Set Blender root: `%APPDATA%\Blender Foundation\Blender`.
3. If the root doesn't exist, create it: `mkdir "%APPDATA%\Blender Foundation\Blender"`.
4. Check for version folders (4.2 to 5.0).
5. For each matching version (e.g., 4.2):
   - Create addons dir if needed: `mkdir "<BlenderRoot>\<version>\scripts\addons"`.
   - Copy files: `copy blender\NV_Trellis_Addon.py "<addons_dir>\NV_Trellis_Addon.py"` and `copy blender\asset_importer.py "<addons_dir>\asset_importer.py"`.
6. If no versions found, create default 4.2 folder and copy addons as above.
7. After copying, enable the addon in Blender preferences.

## Step 13: Deactivate Conda Environment (Temporarily)
1. Run: `conda deactivate`.

## Step 14: Start LLM and Trellis Services
1. Start LLM in background: Open a new Command Prompt and run `conda activate trellis && python nim_llm\run_llama.py`.
2. Wait 10 seconds.
3. Start Trellis in background: Open another Command Prompt and run `conda activate trellis && python nim_trellis\run_trellis.py`.
4. Wait 10 seconds.
5. Check running processes: `tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq python.exe" /FO TABLE`.

## Step 15: Monitor Services Readiness
1. Reactivate environment in main prompt: `conda activate trellis`.
2. Loop to check readiness (up to 150 attempts, ~75 minutes):
   - Run: `python check_services.py`.
   - Interpret exit code:
     - 0: Both ready.
     - 1: LLM ready, Trellis not.
     - 2: Trellis ready, LLM not.
     - Other: Neither ready.
   - Wait 30 seconds between checks.
3. Services endpoints: LLM at `http://localhost:19002`, Trellis at `http://localhost:8000`.
4. If timeout, check logs: `nim_llm\llama_container.log` and `nim_trellis\trellis_container.log`.

## Step 16: Stop Services
1. Stop LLM: `python -c "from nim_llm.manager import stop_container; stop_container()"`.
2. Stop Trellis: `python -c "from nim_trellis.manager import stop_container; stop_container()"`.
3. Kill remaining Python processes: `taskkill /f /im python.exe`.
4. Deactivate environment: `conda deactivate`.

## Completion
If all steps succeed without errors, the installation is complete. You can now use the Trellis environment. Troubleshoot any errors by checking console output, logs, or dependencies. For first-time setups, model downloads and service starts may take significant time (60-120 minutes).
</details>
